tw2 algorithm:Knn
step1: Kernelknn
step2: Load the data
step3: Pre-process the data
step4: Scale the data since the output depends on the distance calculations
step5: labels should be numeric and begin from 1 since classification is used
step6: random split in train-test and test set.
step7: evaluation metric
step8: A simple k-nearest-neighbors can be used in classification 
step9: Choose from existing Kernels which give optimal solutions
step10: choose Self defined Kernel function(Normal Distribution)
step 11: Calculate Accuracy
