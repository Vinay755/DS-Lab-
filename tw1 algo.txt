tw1 Linear Regresion

Step 1: Collection of data from library mlbench
Step 2: Install dplyr for manupulation
Step 3: Use library ggplot2 and reshape2
Step 4: Load data in housing variable
Step 5: By using ggplot x as median and y as density
Step 6: We get density plot of median value house price
Step 7: Get the summary that is median and mean value
Step 8: We get individual graph for each variable
Step 9: Distribute the data sets for traning and testing
	75% traning and 25% testing
Step 10: Fit a linear model
Step 11: Obtain a r-squared value for your model and examine diagnostic plots
Step 12: Create data frame for predicted values and original values
Step 13: Plot to visualize the performance of your model
